Whenever the engine reads an asset especially during a production build it can compile it into a special file that stores all the data in an easy to read binary format for example with meshes.

Then you can have metadata files that are composites of references to multiple compiled resources. for example a model object could store a reference to a mesh, textures, materials which could just be shaders or material resources that hold on to shaders, and finally maybe even a skeleton. the engine would only ever make one file for a compiled asset and everything else that needs to use it will be in these reference or metadata files.

this would be very similar to how a file system stores data.
